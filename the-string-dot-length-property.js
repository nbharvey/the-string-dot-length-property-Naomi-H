Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

// Your code here
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";

let stringTwo = "JavaScript";

let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne = stringOne.length;
console.log(lengthOne);

let lengthTwo = stringTwo.length;  
console.log(lengthTwo);

let lengthThree = stringThree.length; 
console.log(lengthThree);
